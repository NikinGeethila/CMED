# CMED: Child Micro-Expressions Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **Child Micro-Expressions Dataset (CMED)** is the first dataset of its kind, focusing on the detection of **spontaneous micro-expressions in children**. Micro-expressions are involuntary, short bursts of emotion that are difficult to hide and can provide crucial insights for **psychotherapy and emotion recognition**. 

Unlike existing datasets that focus on **adults**, this dataset specifically targets **children**, whose facial expressions exhibit distinct characteristics. The dataset is captured **in the wild** using **video conferencing software**, making it a valuable resource for research in psychology, affective computing, and machine learning.
