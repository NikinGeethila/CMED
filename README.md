# CMED
The Child Micro-Expressions Dataset (CMED) is the first dataset of its kind, focusing on the detection of **spontaneous micro-expressions in children**. Micro-expressions are involuntary, short bursts of emotion that are difficult to hide and can provide crucial insights for psychotherapy and emotion recognition.
